# Emotion-Classification
Takes in training data through a file iterator and trains an 'n' - layered feedforward neural network by simple backpropagation. The neural network is then asked to predict the orientation of the faces and classify them into four categories.

The code is in a single python script file and commented properly to highlight what each function does.

Code Compilation Instructions -
1. Create two folders called test and train.

2.Copy images to train in the train folder. And images to test in the test folder.

3.Open the python file in any Python IDE. I used spyder.

4.Run the script.
